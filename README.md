LocalLA Sports Event App
This application allows users to find local sporting events in the LA area and search and buy tickets at the
lowest price. We used Events API to pull in all the sporting events that are updated daily with new events.
*Created a React.js application making API fetch calls to Seat Geek.
*Used React.js to serve the front-end with Javascript methods and functions.
*Served the back-end of the application using Peewee, Flask and Python3.7 functions utilizing SQLite database management.
*Styled and created the visual aspects using Semantic UI/CSS, HTML5, Flex-Box, CSS3.
*Wireframed and planned UI design of application using Trello.
*Made frequent commits using Git control throughout the production of the application.
